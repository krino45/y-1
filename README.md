some projects from my first year studying at SibSUTIS (coincidentally also the first year learning programming)

## Coursework

this is a program for my coursework and its probably the only thing ill care to upload on github

its a relatively simple playfair ciphering program in russian which does just that - relatively poorly (it cant work with files with newline characters) translates text into ciphered text. Why poorly you might ask? Well, russian alphabet is really really annoying in wchar and some characters are further apart than others, so case control was a nightmare to figure out the result being translatable back into normal text.
